### 1) changed the background to images

### 2) I divided the screen into two parts and placed the direction buttons to move the robot and a counter to increase the steps on the right side.

### 4) To track the robot's movement, I added a body that moves with the buttons, a button to reset the body to its original position, and a counter that resets to 1.

### 5) Here, the robot's movement is in different directions with the counter set to 1, meaning it moves 1 step.
